## Pokemon Auto Chess (Godot)

A very very heavily WIP remake of Pokemon Auto Chess in the Godot game engine. This readme currently only will explain how to import assets for others who wish to use this repo.

- Make a folder called "assets" in this repo.
- Clone [PMDCollab/RawAsset](https://github.com/PMDCollab/RawAsset/tree/03c80dad937911572f8fb19903771a47956fc696) into a separate repo (NOT as a submodule!!)
- Drag and drop files (with their repo directory) into assets, keeping the directory structure in place from the asset repo. For example, Shiny Paldean Wooper's attack spritesheet should be located at `res://assets/Sprite/0194/0002/0001/Attack-Anim.png`
